/**
 * pi's fullscreen renderer draws the whole transcript on every frame — every
 * wheel tick, every streamed token, every hover change — so whatever a box
 * computes in `render` is paid once per box in the history, per frame. These
 * tests pin the caches that keep a long session scrollable, and check that
 * each one still lets go when its input changes.
 *
 * Runs in its own process, so the options set here stay here.
