/**
 * Three-level collapsing for the tool calls of one assistant segment:
 *
 *   0  ▸ 4 calls ·  bash×3  read×1 · 1.2s      (常态;整段工具只剩一行)
 *   1  ▾ 4 calls ·  bash×3  read×1 · 1.2s      (click: back to 0)
 *      │ ✓ bash  cd ~ && python3 - <<'PY' (+26 lines)  0.1s
 *      │ ✓ read  src/app.ts  0.1s
 *   2  │ the full rounded box (what pi renders natively, output preview included)
 *
 * The `│` gutter marks what belongs to the open group. Tools in
 * `alwaysShowTools` (edit/write by default: their diff is the point) never
 * fold — they render as pi's own box and close the group before them, so the
 * calls after one start a new group and the transcript stays in order.
 *
 * One group = the tool calls between two *boundaries*: a user message, or an
 * assistant message with visible text. pi gives every model step its own
 * assistant message, and a step that only calls a tool carries no text — those
 * "carrier" messages do not break the group, so a reply that runs six tools in
 * six steps still folds into one line. The text itself always renders, which is
 * what lets you see a reply drifting.
 *
 * Membership is decided *at render time* from transcript order, which is also
 * what makes it survive a session reload: pi rebuilds the components in order.
 * Every frame renders the whole transcript top to bottom, so a boundary's render
 * only *selects* its group (keyed by the component); it never resets anything.
 * A tool or carrier joins the selected group the first time it renders and stays
 * there.
 *
 * Nothing here touches pi's own expand flag except through `setExpanded`, which
 * is why `ctrl+o` and pi's built-in click-to-expand keep working: both land here
 * first and get translated into "level 1" / "level 2".
